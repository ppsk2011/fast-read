## 3. Full Description

```
ReadSwift is a speed-reading tool built on the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) method. It displays one word at a fixed point on screen, eliminating the eye movement that slows conventional reading. The result: you read faster with less cognitive effort.

Upload any PDF or EPUB file. No account required. No file is ever sent to a server — all processing happens locally on your device. Your reading history and progress are saved on-device and never leave it.

HOW IT WORKS

RSVP removes the back-and-forth eye movement of scanning a printed or scrolling page. By presenting words in one fixed location, your eyes never move. Your brain receives the words without the neural overhead of physical scanning. Most readers improve reading speed 30–50% over their baseline within a week of regular use.

FEATURES

• Load any PDF or EPUB file from your device
• Adjustable reading speed: 60 to 1000 words per minute

PRIVACY

ReadSwift collects zero data. It has no analytics, no tracking, no advertising, no backend server. Your files are processed entirely on your device using the browser's built-in APIs. Reading history is stored locally using your device's storage and is never transmitted anywhere.

TECHNICAL

ReadSwift is a Progressive Web App (PWA) running inside a native Android wrapper (Trusted Web Activity). All PDF processing uses Mozilla's PDF.js library. EPUB processing uses epub.js. Both run entirely in-browser.

Minimum Android version: Android 7.0 (API 24)
Storage: reading history uses under 100 KB of local storage
Permissions: none required

## 5. User Value Proposition

**Primary audience:** Professionals, students, and researchers who need to process large volumes of text quickly.

**Pain point solved:** Conventional reading is slow because the eye scans back and forth across each line. RSVP eliminates this motion. ReadSwift implements RSVP for any document the user already has — no need to buy a proprietary ebook or sign up for a service.
