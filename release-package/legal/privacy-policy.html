    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      <strong>Fast Read</strong> — published by TechScript Limited<br />
      Effective date: 2025-01-01<br />
      Last updated: 2025-06-01
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Fast Read collects no personal data, uses no analytics, contains no advertising, and sends nothing to any server. All document processing occurs locally on your device. This policy documents that in full legal form.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Fast Read is developed and published by <strong>TechScript Limited</strong>, a software company operating at
      <a href="https://techscript.ca" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://techscript.ca</a>.
      For privacy-related inquiries, contact us via the website contact form.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>We collect no personal data.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast Read does not collect, transmit, store on any server, or share any information about you, your device,
      your usage patterns, or the documents you read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, Fast Read does <strong>not</strong> collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, or any account credentials (there are no accounts)</li>
      <li>Device identifiers, advertising IDs, or fingerprints</li>
      <li>IP addresses or location data</li>
      <li>The content of any file you open</li>
      <li>Reading behaviour, session duration, or usage statistics</li>
      <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data</li>
      <li>Any data through analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party SDKs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Fast Read stores the following information <strong>locally on your device only</strong>, using your browser's
      built-in <code>localStorage</code> API:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The name, word count, and last-read position for files you have opened (reading history)</li>
      <li>Your preferred reading speed (words per minute)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored exclusively on your device. It is never transmitted to TechScript Limited or any third party.
      You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser or app storage, or by deleting individual records
      inside the app's Reading History panel.
    </p>

    <h2>4. File Processing</h2>
    <p>
      When you open a PDF or EPUB file in Fast Read, the file is processed entirely within your device using
      in-browser JavaScript libraries (<a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF.js</a>
      by Mozilla and <a href="https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js" rel="noopener noreferrer">epub.js</a>).
      The file content is never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with TechScript Limited or any other party.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Fast Read contains <strong>no analytics software</strong> of any kind. It does not integrate with
      Google Analytics, Firebase, Sentry, Mixpanel, Amplitude, or any other analytics or crash-reporting service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast Read contains <strong>no advertising SDKs</strong>. It displays no advertisements and does not participate
      in any advertising network.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Because we collect no data, there is nothing to share. We do not sell, rent, trade, or transfer any information
      about users to any third party under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Internet Access</h2>
    <p>
      The Fast Read application shell is delivered over the internet when first installed. Thereafter, the app
      operates fully offline — no internet connection is required to read documents. After the initial load, no
      outbound network requests are made during normal use.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Fast Read is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from
      children. Because we collect no information from any user, this policy applies universally regardless of age.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because Fast Read transmits no data to any server, there is no server-side data to secure.
      Data stored locally on your device is subject to your device's own security model (screen lock, encryption,
      app sandboxing). TechScript Limited has no access to your device storage.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If the privacy characteristics of Fast Read change (for example, if a future version adds optional cloud sync),
      this policy will be updated and the effective date revised. The current version will always be published at
      <a href="https://techscript.ca/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://techscript.ca/privacy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not retroactively change data practices for data already collected — which is impossible in any case,
      since no data has been collected.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Because Fast Read collects no personal data, there is no data subject to access, correction, deletion, or
      portability requests under GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, or any other data protection regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have concerns about data stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time through your
      device or browser settings, or from within the app.
    </p>
