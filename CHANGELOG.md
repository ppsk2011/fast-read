## [1.3.0]
### Fixed
- Page Preview jitter eliminated: active word now uses threshold-based instant scroll
  (snaps when past 75% of container) instead of competing smooth-scroll animations
- Page Preview text reflow fixed: `.word` and `.activeWord` both use font-weight: 600;
  active state is differentiated by color only, preventing width-change reflow
- Top bar page number chip (topBarReadPos) removed — redundant with viewport overlay
  and Page Preview header
### Added
- "↩ current" return button in Page Preview header — appears when user has browsed
  away from the reading position (isDetached); clicking snaps view back to current
  reading page and clears detached state
