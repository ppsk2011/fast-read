## Relationship to `release-package/`

This `readswift/` directory contains **product identity, SEO, and discoverability** deliverables.

The sibling `release-package/` directory contains **production asset specifications, design tokens, privacy policy, and deployment runbook**.

Both directories are required for a complete Play Store submission. The typical workflow:

1. Use `readswift/play-store/listing.md` for the Play Console store listing text
2. Use `release-package/` for all icon, screenshot, and APK production steps
3. Use `release-package/legal/privacy-policy.html` as the deployed privacy policy
4. Use `readswift/seo/` for the landing page and SEO
