**Company:** Techscript Limited

**Document version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Production

## 1. Brand Identity Statement

**ReadSwift is a precision reading instrument that eliminates the physical overhead of eye movement so that knowledge workers can process text at the speed their mind allows.**

It is not a content platform. It is not a library. It is not a social reading app. It is a cognitive performance tool for people who read to learn, not to be entertained.

---

## 2. Product Positioning

### Category

**Speed-reading utility** — a tool, not a destination.

ReadSwift belongs in the same mental category as a text editor or a calculator: a focused instrument with one job, executed precisely.

### Market position

| Dimension | ReadSwift | Traditional e-reader | Speed-reading subscription app |
|---|---|---|---|
| Works with user's own files | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No account required | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No subscription | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No data sent to servers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Works offline | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| PDF support | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| EPUB support | ✅ | ✅ | Partial |
| RSVP method | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Free | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Competitive wedge:** The combination of RSVP technique + bring-your-own-file + zero data collection + free is not available from any competitor. ReadSwift owns this intersection.

### Positioning statement (internal)

> For students, engineers, and knowledge workers who need to read large volumes of text quickly, ReadSwift is the only speed-reading tool that works with the PDFs and EPUBs they already own, requires no account, and sends nothing to the cloud.

## 3. Value Proposition

### Primary value proposition

**Read the same document in half the time. No training. No subscription. No account.**

### Supporting proof points

1. **RSVP method** — Rapid Serial Visual Presentation eliminates eye-scanning, the primary speed bottleneck for most adult readers.
2. **Your files, your device** — Drag in any PDF or EPUB. Processing runs entirely in-browser using Mozilla PDF.js and epub.js. No upload, no wait.
3. **Configurable speed** — 60 to 1000 words per minute. Adjustable in real time. Your pace, your control.
4. **Zero friction** — No account creation, no email verification, no onboarding sequence. Open the app, load a file, press play.
5. **Progress memory** — ReadSwift saves your position in every document automatically. Close the app, come back tomorrow, resume exactly where you stopped.

### One-line elevator pitch

**ReadSwift: one word at a time, at the speed your brain works.**

## 4. Technical Identity

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Architecture | React Progressive Web App (PWA) |
| Android delivery | Trusted Web Activity (TWA) via Capacitor |
| PDF engine | Mozilla PDF.js (in-browser, WASM-accelerated) |

## 5. Tone of Voice

### Character

Precise. Functional. Credible. Dry. Never self-congratulatory.

ReadSwift speaks like senior engineering documentation — accurate, minimal, no adjectives that can't be measured. It respects the reader's intelligence and does not over-explain.

### Voice rules

| Use | Avoid |
|---|---|
| Describe what the tool does | Describe how it will make you feel |
| Specific numbers (1000 WPM, 0 accounts) | Superlatives (fastest, best, amazing) |
| "processes locally" | "keeps your data safe" (vague) |
| "no account required" | "completely hassle-free" |
| "configurable" | "powerful" |
| "zero" | "none whatsoever" (redundant) |
| Second person direct ("you read") | Third person passive ("reading is enhanced") |

### Sample copy (correct tone)

> ReadSwift displays one word at a time at the exact centre of the screen. Your eyes stop moving. You read faster.

> Load any PDF or EPUB. No upload. No account. All processing runs on your device.

> Set your speed from 60 to 1000 words per minute. Adjust while reading. Your progress is saved automatically.

### Sample copy (incorrect tone — avoid)

> ❌ Experience a revolutionary new way to read that will transform your relationship with books!
> ❌ Our powerful AI-driven reading platform helps you become the reader you've always wanted to be.
> ❌ Beautifully designed for the modern learner.

| Text primary | `#f0f0f0` | All primary text |

| Accent blue | `#2d6af6` | Primary CTA, reading progress |

## 8. Product Name Rationale

**ReadSwift** = Read + Swift

- "Read" — the literal action. Unambiguous.
- "Swift" — speed and precision. Connotes both velocity and reliability (Swift programming language reference builds technical credibility with the target audience).
- Compound noun — memorable, two syllables, no special characters.
- Domain-friendly: `readswift.com`, `readswift.app` likely available.
- App Store / Play Store search: "ReadSwift" is not a common word — brand recognition transfers to search instantly.
