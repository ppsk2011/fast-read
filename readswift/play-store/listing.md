## 3. Full Description

```
ReadSwift is a speed-reading tool for anyone who needs to get through large volumes of text quickly. It uses the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) method — displaying one word at a time at a fixed point on the screen — to eliminate the eye movement that makes conventional reading slow.

Load any PDF or EPUB directly from your device. No upload. No account. ReadSwift processes your files locally using proven open-source libraries. Your documents never leave your device.

WHY RSVP WORKS

Conventional reading requires your eyes to scan back and forth across each line. This physical motion — saccadic eye movement — consumes time and cognitive energy that could otherwise be spent understanding the text. RSVP removes it entirely. Every word arrives at the same fixed point. Your eyes stay still. Your reading speed increases.

Most users read 200–250 words per minute with conventional scanning. ReadSwift users regularly reach 400–600 WPM within the first week of regular practice, with comprehension remaining stable up to approximately 500 WPM for familiar subjects.
