## 3. Problem Section

### Section heading

```
Why Reading Feels Slow
```

### Body copy

```
The bottleneck isn't your brain. It's your eyes.

When you read a printed page or a scrolling screen, your eyes move constantly — 
left to right across each line, then back to the start of the next. This motion, 
called saccadic scanning, consumes time you aren't aware of spending.

A typical adult reads at 200–250 words per minute. Most of that time is physical 
eye travel, not text comprehension. Your brain is waiting.

ReadSwift removes the motion entirely.
```

## 4. Solution Section

### Section heading

```
One Word. One Point. No Scanning.
```

### Body copy

```
ReadSwift displays your document one word at a time at a single fixed point on the 
screen. Your eyes don't move. The words come to you.

This technique — Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) — is backed by decades of 
reading science research. It works because it removes the physical overhead of reading 
without reducing comprehension.

Load a PDF or EPUB from your device. Set your speed. Press play. That's it.

## 5. How It Works Section

### Section heading

```
How ReadSwift Works
```

### Steps

**Step 1 — Load your document**

```
Tap "Open file" and select any PDF or EPUB from your device. 
ReadSwift extracts the text entirely on your device — nothing is uploaded.
```

**Step 2 — Set your speed**

```
Choose your reading speed: 60 to 1000 words per minute. 
Start at 300 WPM if you're new to RSVP. 
Increase by 50 WPM per session as your pace improves.
```

**Step 3 — Press play**

```
One word appears at the centre of the screen. The next word replaces it. 
Your eyes stay still. Your brain reads at the pace you set.
```

**Step 4 — Resume any time**

```
ReadSwift saves your position in every document automatically. 
Close the app. Come back tomorrow. 
Your place is exactly where you left it.
```

```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Q: What file formats does ReadSwift support?**

```
A: ReadSwift supports PDF (.pdf) and EPUB (.epub) files. 
   Files must be loaded from your local device — ReadSwift does not connect 
   to cloud storage services or download from URLs.
```

**Q: Does ReadSwift work offline?**

```
A: Yes. After the app is installed, no internet connection is required. 
   All text processing runs locally in your browser using PDF.js and epub.js.

   Reading history is stored in your device's local storage and never leaves it.
```

**Q: What is RSVP reading?**

```
A: RSVP stands for Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Instead of displaying a full 
   paragraph that your eyes must scan, RSVP shows one word at a time at a fixed 
   point. Your eyes stay still. Words arrive at a configured rate. The result: 
   faster reading with less physical effort.
```

**Q: How fast can I actually read with ReadSwift?**

```
A: Most new users start at 250–350 WPM. With one week of regular use, 
   400–500 WPM is achievable for most readers with full comprehension. 
   Expert-level RSVP users reach 700–900 WPM for familiar subject matter. 
   ReadSwift supports up to 1000 WPM.
