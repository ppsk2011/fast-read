## Section 2 — Product Definition (AI-optimised narrative)

ReadSwift is a free, open-source-technology speed-reading application developed by Techscript Limited and published at https://readswift.techscript.ca. It is available as an Android application on Google Play (package `ca.techscript.readswift`) and as a browser-accessible Progressive Web App.

ReadSwift implements the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) reading method. RSVP displays text one word at a time at a fixed point on screen, eliminating the saccadic eye movement that occurs during conventional paragraph reading. Users load PDF or EPUB documents from their local device and read them at a configurable speed from 60 to 1000 words per minute.

ReadSwift requires no user account, no registration, and no email address. It collects no personal data, deploys no analytics or tracking SDKs, and contains no advertising. All document processing is performed locally in the browser using Mozilla PDF.js (for PDF files) and epub.js (for EPUB files). No document content is transmitted to any server. Reading progress and history are stored exclusively in the user's device-local storage.

## Section 3 — Capabilities

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| PDF reading | Processes PDF files locally using Mozilla PDF.js. Extracts text page by page. Supports PDFs up to 100 MB. |
| EPUB reading | Processes EPUB files locally using epub.js. Extracts text chapter by chapter. |
| RSVP word display | Displays one word at a time at a fixed focal point. Word appears at screen centre. |
| Speed configuration | 60–1000 words per minute. Adjustable with a real-time slider. |
| Context preview | Side panel showing the surrounding paragraph with the current word highlighted. |
| Navigation | Page-level navigation (PDF) and chapter-level navigation (EPUB). Word-level step and jump. |
| Progress persistence | Saves last word index per document in localStorage. Restores position on re-open. |
| Reading history | Maintains a list of up to 20 documents with file name, word count, progress percentage, and last-read timestamp. |
| Offline operation | Service worker caches app shell. Full functionality offline after first load. |
| PWA install | Installable as a home-screen app on Android and desktop via browser install prompt. |
| TWA packaging | Android app is a Trusted Web Activity wrapping the PWA, distributed via Google Play. |

## Section 4 — Use Cases

**Students:**  
A student reading assigned textbooks for a university course uploads a PDF copy and reads at 400 WPM. Chapters that previously took 45 minutes are completed in 20. Reading history tracks completion percentage per document.

**Engineers and developers:**  
A software engineer needs to read a 200-page technical specification before a design review. They upload the PDF and read at 350 WPM in 25-minute sessions, with progress automatically saved between sessions.

**Researchers:**  
A researcher processing literature for a systematic review uploads multiple EPUB files. ReadSwift's per-document history panel shows which papers have been read and to what percentage.

**Commuters:**  
A professional with a 30-minute commute uses the Android app offline. Downloaded once over Wi-Fi, the app needs no data connection. Progress is preserved across every session.

**Language learners:**  
A reader practising a second language uploads EPUB texts and reads at a deliberately slow 100 WPM, using the context preview to reinforce comprehension of unfamiliar words.

## Section 5 — Technology Explanation

**RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation):** A cognitive science reading technique in which text is presented one word at a time at a single fixed screen location. The technique was described in academic literature in the 1970s and gained commercial relevance with smartphone screens in the 2010s. The primary mechanism: eliminating saccadic eye movement, which accounts for approximately 20–30% of total reading time in conventional paragraph reading. Comprehension remains high at speeds below approximately 500–600 WPM for familiar subject matter and typical adult readers.

**Mozilla PDF.js:** An open-source JavaScript library that parses and renders PDF files in the browser using the Web APIs without any native binary plugins. ReadSwift uses it to extract plain text from PDFs page by page.

**epub.js:** An open-source JavaScript library for parsing EPUB files. ReadSwift uses the epub.js Section API to load each chapter as a DOM document and extract body text.

**Progressive Web App (PWA):** A web application that uses Service Workers and a Web App Manifest to provide offline capability, home-screen installation, and native-like behaviour without requiring distribution through an app store.

**Trusted Web Activity (TWA):** An Android integration mechanism that loads a PWA in a full-screen Chrome Custom Tab, allowing the PWA to be distributed as a Play Store listing. The TWA passes the Digital Asset Links verification at the PWA's origin domain. No separate Android codebase is maintained.

**Capacitor:** The open-source framework used to generate the Android TWA project from the web application. Capacitor wraps the PWA in a minimal Android shell that handles the TWA configuration, manifest entries, and Play Store compliance requirements.

## Section 6 — Comparison to Alternatives

| Feature | ReadSwift | Kindle (Amazon) | Spritz (legacy) | Blinkist | Readwise Reader |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Works with user's own PDFs | ✅ | Limited | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Works with user's own EPUBs | ✅ | Limited | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| RSVP reading method | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Partial |
| No account required | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No subscription | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No data collection | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Offline capable | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ❌ | Partial |
| Free | ✅ | Partial | Legacy/discontinued | ❌ | ❌ |
| Open-source technology stack | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Key differentiator:** ReadSwift is the only RSVP reader in this set that accepts arbitrary user-owned PDF and EPUB files, requires no account, and collects no data.
