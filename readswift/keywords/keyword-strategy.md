## 2. User Intent Mapping

### Intent type: Informational ("How do I…")

Users searching these queries are early in the decision funnel. They need education about RSVP and speed-reading methodology before a product pitch.

| User query | Underlying intent | ReadSwift response |
|---|---|---|
| "how to read faster" | Wants technique, not product | Explain RSVP method; ReadSwift implements it |
| "does reading faster work" | Sceptical, researching | Evidence-based explanation of RSVP research |
| "what is RSVP reading" | Curious, unfamiliar | Clear definition + demonstration |
| "can I read 1000 wpm" | Aspirational, curious | Realistic explanation; ReadSwift lets them practise |

**Content action:** Write FAQ and blog content targeting these queries. Link to the ReadSwift tool. Rank for informational queries, convert to tool users.

### Intent type: Transactional ("I want to download / find…")

High commercial intent. Direct product match.

| User query | Underlying intent | Match quality |
|---|---|---|
| "speed reading app Android" | Ready to install | ✅ Direct match |
| "PDF speed reader free" | Ready to install, price-sensitive | ✅ Direct match |
| "RSVP reader app" | Technical user, knows what they want | ✅ Direct match |
| "read books faster app" | Ready to install | ✅ Direct match |
| "EPUB reader without account" | Privacy-sensitive, ready to install | ✅ Direct match |

**Content action:** Play Store listing title and description must contain these exact phrases. Landing page H1 and meta description must match these queries.

### Intent type: Comparative ("What is better than X")

Users comparing options.

| User query | Implicit reference | Differentiation |
|---|---|---|
| "spritz alternatives" | Spritz (legacy RSVP app) | ReadSwift works with any PDF/EPUB; Spritz requires proprietary content |
| "Kindle speed reading" | Amazon Kindle | Kindle doesn't do RSVP; ReadSwift does |
| "free speed reading app alternative" | Paid competitors | ReadSwift is free, no account, works with own files |
| "offline PDF reader speed" | Acrobat, other PDF apps | ReadSwift is specifically a speed reader, not a PDF annotator |

## 3. App Store Optimisation (ASO) Strategy

### Title optimisation

**Primary title:** `ReadSwift: Speed Reader`

- "ReadSwift" — brand name, 9 chars, unique, owns search position
- "Speed Reader" — highest-volume keyword pair for the category
- Total: 22 chars / 50 char limit — room for A/B variation

**A/B variants to test:**

| Variant | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `ReadSwift: PDF & EPUB Speed Reader` | Adds file format keywords |
| `ReadSwift — Read Faster, 1 Word at a Time` | Benefit-led |
| `ReadSwift: RSVP Reading Tool` | Technical audience targeting |

### Short description optimisation (80 chars)

**Primary:** `Read PDFs and EPUBs 2× faster with RSVP. No account, no data.` — 62 chars ✅

**Variants to test:**

| Variant | Chars |
|---|---|
| `Speed through PDFs and EPUBs one word at a time. No account.` | 61 |
| `RSVP speed reader for PDFs and EPUBs. Free, offline, no login.` | 63 |

### Keyword field (Google Play — 100 chars, comma-separated, no spaces after commas)

```
speed reading,PDF reader,EPUB reader,RSVP,read faster,speed reader,study,productivity
```

100 chars ✅

**Rules applied:**
- No brand name in keyword field (it already appears in title)
- No duplicate of words already in title
- Most specific terms first (higher conversion), broader terms last
- No plurals where singular works (Android indexes both)

### Rating and review strategy

- Initial store description should set correct expectations to prevent negative reviews from users expecting a different type of app
- Version 1.0 launch: solicit reviews from beta users / personal network before public launch
- Respond to all reviews within 48 hours — Play Store treats response rate as a quality signal

### Category placement

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary category | Productivity |
| Secondary tag | Education |
| Content rating | Everyone |

## 4. Semantic Product Definition

A machine-readable plain-language description that can be used in structured data, AI context blocks, and metadata fields.

```
ReadSwift is a free Android and web application by Techscript Limited that implements
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) speed reading. It accepts PDF and EPUB files
from the user's local device, extracts plain text, and displays one word at a time
at a fixed point on the screen at a user-configured speed between 60 and 1000 words
per minute. No internet connection is required during reading. No user account is needed.
No file content or reading data is transmitted to any server. Reading progress is
saved locally on the device. The application is a Progressive Web App deployed as
a Trusted Web Activity on Android via the Google Play Store.
```

## 5. Long-Tail Keyword Opportunities

These are low-competition, high-specificity queries with strong conversion:

| Long-tail keyword | Monthly est. | Competition | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|
| "speed reading app no account" | Low | Very low | ✅ Own it |
| "RSVP reader for PDF Android" | Low | Very low | ✅ Own it |
| "read epub faster android" | Low | Low | ✅ Own it |
| "one word at a time reading app" | Low | Very low | ✅ Own it |
| "offline speed reading app android" | Low | Low | ✅ Own it |
| "free rsvp reading app" | Low | Low | ✅ Own it |
| "upload pdf and read faster" | Low | Very low | ✅ Own it |

These long-tail terms have negligible competition. Creating one page of content per cluster (or a single well-structured FAQ page) will rank for all of them within 60–90 days of indexing.
